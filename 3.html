<h2>javascript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language. It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use[1]. JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js[2], or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.

    Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming language Java. Though the names of both languages are trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated organizations.

    Syntax
    A JavaScript program is made of a collection of instructions called "statements". A semicolon marks the end of a statement, and allows multiple statements to be placed on the same line. However, it is typical to write each statement on its own line to keep a program file readable.
    
    Variables can be defined in several ways. In an older version named "ES5", variables are defined using the var keyword.[3] In the newer versions after ES5, variables can be defined using const for constant variables and let for local variables.[4][5] The value of constant variables cannot be re-declared or reassigned. Variables assigned using const or let are contained within blocks, while variables assigned using var are contained within functions.</p>
